# PROJECT TITLE - VICSAFE

### Problem Statement

International students between the ages 18 to 29 years old who are new to Victoria are unaware of their rights and the laws here and do not know which are the safest places to live in, so due to this they are more susceptible to becoming victims of crimes.  

### Problem Solution

Our proposed solution is providing an easily accessible platform to help users learn more about their legal rights in Victoria, as well as provide users with a way to locate the nearest emergency services and community legal aid centres around them through an easy to view and understandable visuals. The solution will also provide users with a way to know how safe any local government area is through an integrated search function.
